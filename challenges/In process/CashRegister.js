// Cash Register
// Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.

// cid is a 2D array listing available currency.

// The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.

// Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.

// Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.

// Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.

function checkCashRegister(price, cash, cid) {
	let result = {};
	const current = {
		Penny: 0.01,
		Nickel: 0.05,
		Dime: 0.1,
		Quarter: 0.25,
		Dollar: 1,
		Five: 5,
		Ten: 10,
		Twenty: 20,
		"One hundred ": 100,
	};
	return { status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: [] };
}
