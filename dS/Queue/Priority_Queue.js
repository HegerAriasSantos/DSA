/*What is a priority queue?

A priority queue is an abstract data type that behaves similarly to the normal queue except that each element has some priority, i.e., the element with the highest priority would come first in a priority queue. The priority of the elements in a priority queue will determine the order in which elements are removed from the priority queue. 


* Characteristics of a Priority queue *

A priority queue is an extension of a queue that contains the following characteristics:

- Every element in a priority queue has some priority associated with it.
- An element with the higher priority will be deleted before the deletion of the lesser priority.
- If two elements in a priority queue have the same priority, they will be arranged using the FIFO principle.
